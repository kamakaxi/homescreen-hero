## Why homescreen-hero?

homescreen-hero is for Plex users who want more control over how their libraries feel, not just how they're stored. It brings together collection management, automation, personalization, and server tools in one self-hosted app, all so that you get to choose what appears, when it appears, and who sees it.

> **Transparency note:** While I am a professional engineer, homescreen-hero was built with a lot of help from AI coding tools, especially for frontend work and iteration. It's still actively designed, tested, reviewed, and maintained by a human(s), and being transparent about that process is important to me.

## Features

- **Web Dashboard:** Customizable drag-and-drop dashboard with widgets for Tautulli, Seerr, library analytics, and more
- **Smart Rotation:** Scheduled rotations with rule-based groups, smart filters, and random/weighted/LRU strategies
- **Per-User Targeting:** Show or hide collections per Plex user so every homescreen feels personalized
- **3rd Party List Sync:** Sync collections from Trakt, Letterboxd, MDBList, TMDb, AniList, and MAL. Auto-request missing items through Seerr.
- **Collection Sharing:** Share your custom built Plex collections with other users via exportable JSON files or shareable codes
- **Authentication:** Password login, Plex OAuth, or both (with role-based access control for future non-admin features)
- **Plex Tools:** Date Added Editor, Watch History Cleaner, Unwatched Reports, Copy Watch History, and more

## Quick Start

For all installation methods, including more detailed setup instructions, see the [Installation docs](https://docs.homescreenhero.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

**Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), a running [Plex server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/), and your [Plex token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)

> **Security tip:** Want to keep secrets out of config files? Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your sensitive values *before* running the wizard. The wizard will automatically use your environment variables instead of writing them to config.yaml.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trentferguson/homescreen-hero.git
cd homescreen-hero
mkdir -p data
docker-compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8000 (or whichever port you specified in .env file) and the Setup Wizard will guide you through configuration.


### Windows Portable (Beta)

A portable Windows build is available as a zip download on each [Release](https://github.com/trentferguson/homescreen-hero/releases/latest). See the [Windows Portable (Beta)](https://docs.homescreenhero.com/docs/getting-started/installation#windows-portable-beta) docs for installation instructions.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Plex URL, token, and any integration API keys. The Setup Wizard handles the rest on first launch.

See the [Environment Variables](https://docs.homescreenhero.com/docs/getting-started/environment-variables) and [Configuration](https://docs.homescreenhero.com/docs/getting-started/configuration) docs for the full reference.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

-   [**Agregarr:**](https://github.com/agregarr/agregarr) For being an amazing self-hosted app and inspiring me to try building something myself. Seriously, this app is awesome.
-   [**ColleXions:**](https://github.com/jl94x4/ColleXions) For initially doing exactly what I needed this app today. Another great inspiration for me to try my own hand at an creating something like this.
-   **Stitch (Google):** For helping me come up with a clean frontend design philosophy. It took a lot of trial error (I have almost no frontend dev experience, but turns out I'm very picky about what it looks like lol)
-   **Claude Code, Chat GPT, and Github Copilot:** For building ~90% of my frontend. As a Data Engineer, a big part of creating this app for myself was to get a true understanding of where AI Coding Agents stand today, and what exactly they can/cannot do. I got tired of the headlines/Reddit comments and figured this was the quickest way to the truth.

## 🐶 Puppy Tax 
I'm not ashamed to use my cutie for free internet points! (she was also great moral support on the *"I've been banging my head against a wall for days trying to figure out why the rotation runs every thirty seconds* types of issues lol)
